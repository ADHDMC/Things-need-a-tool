This datapack puts most commonly-used blocks that do not have a "correct tool" (tool that will mine them faster/tool where efficiency will apply) into tool sections, so they can finally not be left out, with players spending 500 years taking down their glass roof that wasn't so well thought out

  - `white_stained_glass`
